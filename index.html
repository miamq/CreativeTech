    <h2>PROJECT 1: TECHNO-KLUDGING</h2>
    <p>Do you have a technology-dependent creative project in your head that you want to build? Do you look at a particular kind of work by other interactive designers/artists and think "I wish I knew how to make that!" In this project, we're dropping you in at the deep end. We want you to propose a creative technology project, and we're going to try to help you build it. Or, more accurately, we're going to help you identify and kludge together a small critical piece of it. The question of scope – figuring out what that "small critical piece" is – is fundamental here, and will underlie many of our discussions as your projects progress.</p>

    <p>To "kludge" is to use an ill-assorted collection of parts to make something. It typically has negative connotations, suggesting something that has been quickly and shoddily put together. But kludging can be a valuable part of an iterative, exploratory, creative design process as we move back and forth between thinking and making, concept and prototype. This is especially true when working with (and designing) interactive technologies, where we are concerned with dynamic experiences and behaviors.</p>

    <h3>The Technological Artifact - <a href="https://v2.nl/archive/articles/global-interior-project">GLOBAL INTERIOR PROJECT</a></h3>
    <p>The Global Interior Project is a Networked Multi-User Virtual Environment where people can meet, talk and discover the metaphysics of reality. </p>

    <h3>My Project</h3>
    <p>Tool: Unity, OpenCV</p>
    <p>Description: The FaceDector script will detect the human face and map the face to the plane in the unity scene. Meanwhile, the location of the face will be recorded and the PC model will move based on the movement of the face. </p>

    <h2>PROJECT 2: SIMULATION & DESIGN</h2>
    <p>Climatological, social, and technological changes are occurring increasingly at a global, rather than regional, scale. While addressing issues of this complexity has always required the collaboration of multiple forms of scientific expertise, inexpensive super-computation and accessible software allows designers to engage with topics long considered strictly the purview of these scientific researchers and engineers.</p>
    <p>For this project, you will create a vivarium: a micro-world where a defined set of properties and behaviors are placed and developed. As a starting point, you will be assigned one of the following verbs, each inspired by a current global crisis, nearing a tipping point: a condition where a controlling system is overwhelmed, sometimes beyond potential return or repair.</p>

    <h3>My Project - Drying</h3>
    <p>Tool: Unity</p>
    <p>Description: It is an imaginary world where the land gets drying and plants get dying. The weather system is thrown into chaos, with toxic rain pouring down. Unknown creatures invade and take over the land. What could they be? We're about to find out. </p>
